To address the NULL comparison issue, always use the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` operators. To ensure correct operator precedence in complex queries, explicitly use parentheses to group operations as intended. To avoid implicit data type conversion errors, ensure that data types are consistent in comparisons by using explicit casting functions (e.g., `CAST`, `CONVERT`) to match the types involved. 

Corrected NULL comparison:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL;
```
Example of using parentheses for precedence control:
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE (customer_id = 1 AND order_date > '2024-01-01') OR total_amount > 1000;
```
Example of explicit type conversion:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE CAST(product_id AS VARCHAR(10)) = '123';
```
