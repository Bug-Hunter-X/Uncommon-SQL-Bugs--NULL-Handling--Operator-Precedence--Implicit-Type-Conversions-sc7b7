In SQL, a common oversight is neglecting to handle NULL values appropriately.  For instance, using the `=` operator to compare a column to NULL will always return false, even if the column contains a NULL value.  The correct approach involves using the `IS NULL` operator or `IS NOT NULL` operator for NULL checks.  Another error stems from misinterpreting the order of operations in complex queries with multiple JOINs, aggregations, and WHERE clauses. Without careful use of parentheses to dictate the desired order, the results can be unexpected.  Additionally, subtle issues can arise from implicit data type conversions that lead to unexpected results or errors.  For example, comparing a string column to an integer value without explicit conversion might lead to erroneous comparisons.

Example of a problematic NULL comparison:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id = NULL; -- Incorrect
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL; -- Correct
```
